            <h1>About Me!</h1>
            <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
            <p> Im a junior web developer who enjoys building clean,structured,
                and functional web experiences. Im especialaly interested in how
                logic, design, and usability come together to create applications
                that are not only technically solid but also easy and pleasant to use.
                For me, writing code is not just about making things work, but about
                making them understandable, maintaainable, and meaningful.</p>
            <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>
            <p> Alongside web development, I have a strong interest in graphic
                design. This helps me think visually when working on interfaces,
                layouts, and overall presentation. I enjoy paying attention to spacing,
                hierarchy, and clarity so that users can interact with a product
                intuitively. Combining design thinking with development allows me to
                approach problems from both a technical and visual perspective..</p>
            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p> I also like teaching and sharing knowledge. I like explaining
                concepts in a simple and structured way, especially when dealing
                with topics that may feel complex at first. Whether through
                discussions, small guides, or examples, I find satisfaction in helping
                others understand how things work. Teaching also helps me deepen
                my own understanding and improve how I communicate ideas.</p>
            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p> Writing is where I slow down and think deeply. I use writing to 
                break down complex ideas, reflect on my learning journey, and express
                thoughts that may not always fit into code. It helps me sharpen my
                understanding and communicate ideas more clearly, both for myself
                and for others.</p>
